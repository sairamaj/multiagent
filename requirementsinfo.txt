You are an AI system designer. I want you to analyze my application requirements and produce a complete system plan.

## 1. Context
We have an existing internal portal where users can type natural language commands. We want to integrate an AI-driven multi-agent system that can perform DevOps and Azure automation tasks.

## 2. Goal of the System
Build a manager-agent + multiple dev-agents architecture using Python and Autogen. The system should interpret user natural language, decide which agent should execute the task, run the task, and return results back to the portal.

## 3. Functional Requirements
- Accept natural language commands such as:
  - “Give me application virtual machines”
  - “Clean up old virtual images”
- Manager agent:
  - Understand intent
  - Break down tasks
  - Delegate to appropriate dev agent
  - Collect results and return summary
- Dev agents:
  - Azure resource management agent
  - Build monitoring agent
  - Local file system agent
  - Additional agents as needed
- System must execute tasks such as:
  - Query Azure resources
  - Delete unused VM images
  - Monitor build pipelines
  - Perform local file operations
- Provide job execution reports back to the portal.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- Secure credential handling (Azure Key Vault)
- Scalable execution (Azure Container Apps or AKS)
- Reliable messaging between agents (Azure Service Bus)
- Logging and monitoring (App Insights)

## 5. Constraints
- Must run in Azure environment
- Must integrate with existing portal
- Must use Azure OpenAI API key already available

## 6. Technologies to Use
- Python + Autogen framework
- Azure OpenAI
- Azure Service Bus
- Azure Container Apps / AKS
- Azure Key Vault
- Azure DevOps REST API
- Azure Resource Manager APIs

## 7. Expected Output
Produce:
- High-level architecture
- Detailed component design
- Agent roles and responsibilities
- Sequence diagrams for:
  - User → Manager agent → Dev agent → Portal
- Deployment plan for Azure
- Security considerations
- Scalability recommendations
